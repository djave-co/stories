If you ever wanted to know how to play <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b>, this adventure is for you.
You'll take on the role of a character in a collaborative story, just like you would in a game of D&D, and we'll guide you through the details. You'll have fewer options here than with a proper Dungeon Master, but never the less, you'll decide what happens by what you choose to do.

=DnDExp
<b>Dungeons & Dragons</b> is an immensely popular game where players use their imaginations to take on the roles of heroes in a fantasy world filled with monsters and magic.
D&D is usually played at a table or online by a group of friends who play as a group of adventurers and a <b>Dungeon Master</b>, who handles the rules and monsters.
D&D was created in 1974 and is played all around the globe by people of all ages. The only thing that's missing is you.

Your story starts in <b>Neverwinter</b>, a legendary city along the northwest edge of the Forgotten Realms. It is a place where all manner of things can be found and its many peoples (elves and dwarves among them) bustle between the city's culturally divergent districts. Still, daily life goes on in the City of Skilled Hands.

=FGExp
The land of <b>Faerûn</b> or as it's better known, the Forgotten Realms, is a fantasy world of magic and monsters, of peril and wonder. Ancient civilizations have come and gone over an eon and the ruins of great fallen nations have been built upon each other. Just below the surface could lie the sprawling ruins of a bygone capital or the hallowed graves of past heroes. A great adventure could be around any corner.

=FGExp2
From the bitter, windswept steppes of the Endless Waste to the storm-lashed cliffs of the Sword Coast stretches a wide, wild land of shining kingdoms and primal wilderness, <b>Faerûn</b> is only one continent of the world known as Toril. Other lands lie in distant corners of the world, but <b>Faerûn</b> is the center of it all, the crossroads and crux upon which all else turns. Dozens of nations, hundreds of city-states, and countless tribes, villages, and settlements dot its expanse.
Countless millions of <b>humans</b>, <b>elves</b>, <b>dwarves</b>, <b>halflings</b>, and other sentient beings call <b>Faerûn</b> home. It is a land of magic and intrigue, cruel violence and divine compassion, where gods have ascended and died, and millennia of warfare and conquests have shaped dozens of unique cultures.

<b>Clerics</b> balance helping their allies with healing or inspiring magic with spells that harm or hinder their foes. As a cleric, you wield magic given by a god. You revere the deity Marthammor Duin, who watches over travelers and outcasts.

<b>Fighters</b> are masters of martial combat, skilled with a variety of weapons and armor. They learn the basics of all combat styles and specialize in one favored form (in your case, archery). The combination of broad general ability and specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
    + [Yes, that's me.] ->Fighter
    + [No, that's not me.] ->CharacterSelect

=maybePaladin
<b>Paladins</b> swear oaths to gods, ancient orders, and great causes. A paladin’s oath is a powerful bond that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. You swore your oath to the god Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice.
    + [Yes, that's me.] ->Paladin
    + [No, that's not me.] ->CharacterSelect

<b>Rogues</b> develop broad expertise that few other characters can match. When it comes to battle, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength, placing one precise strike exactly where the attack will hurt the most.

    + [No, that's not me.] ->CharacterSelect

You are asleep and dreaming. A shadow creeps across the sea like a shroud, swallowing an island in darkness. You know that within that black cloud is a formless force of hunger and death. From above, a voice made of light calls out for you to step forward and then...
And then you wake in a cold sweat. You've had the same disturbing dream for months and it's made your life at the city watch difficult. The lack of sleep causes you to doze off at your post nearly every day now and people have started to notice.
    + [Okay.] -> ClericStart2

You can't help but shake from your mind that you know this island. You recall seeing an image similar to the one in your dream inked in a tome somewhere in the <b>archive annex</b>. 
Perhaps these dreams could be a sign from your god. A calling to something more...
    + [I go to the archive annex.] -> ClericEncounter1

==== FighterStart ====
You’ve spent the last few years in <b>Neverwinter</b> as a carpenter working at the city’s bustling docks. On this particular morning, you smell the salty air and hear the squawking of seagulls through the window over your workbench. The owner of the woodworking shop, a master of some renown named Ettain, looks sorrowfully at the crossbeam you've been planing. "You'll get there, kid," he says, but his eyes retell what you've been told by others in Neverwinter again and again: you're destined for much more than carpentry.
Today the folk among the docks are in a exceedingly bright mood. Smiles are exchanged each time you look out your window. "Mornin', hero!" one of them calls as they pass. "Hero" is the nickname you've been given since you helped run a local trouble-maker out of town. People say it as a joke, but someday, you’ll come into your own. Someday you’ll be a real hero.
    + [Okay.] ->FighterStart2

The shopbell rings and you look up. Your friend <b>Shawelay</b> stands at the door. "I need to talk to you, tonight." She gives you a serious look. "Let's meet at the <b>Beached Leviathan</b>, in the hold. It's important." 
You recall the place immediately, a local tavern for sailors and scallywags.
     + [Agree to meet.] ->FighterStart3

=FighterStart3
You agree, but she dismisses any further questioning from you. In an instant she swings out of the shop just as quickly as she came, but calls through the window as she goes "See you then, hero. Six o' clock."

Fortunes in <b>Neverwinter</b> have been fair but not the fast riches you hoped for. You'd followed a lead of stolen treasure that took you to the city, but that trail has gone cold. You lean back in your chair at a tavern. You're getting tired of this rat race. When's your ship going to come in?
"Pssst! Hey, you'll never believe what I just heard." comes a whispered voice of <b>Sherraf</b>, a friend of yours whose position as a bartender has granted you often amusing and sometimes prosperous second-hand stories. "Well that smuggler's treasure you keep talking about? I think it's real." He says with a smile.
"Did you ever doubt me?" you smile back.
    + "Go on[."]," you plead. -> RogueStart2

=RogueStart2
"Okay, well, turns out the harbormaster has a docket with a Gilder's name and address. They must have be looking to skip town, only thing, they never made it on the boat. Captain of the guard seems to think there's something hidden at that address."
 + "Says who?"[] you inquire.. -> RogueStart3

=RogueStart3
"It comes from a reliable source... and a woman of the temple," <b>Sherraf</b> offers this but will say no more.
This might be it. The story you'd heard was of a high-ranking member of the <b>Gilded Gallows</b> who turned traitor, killed their partner, and fled with a sovereign’s ransom in treasure. Thanks to details you’d picked up here and there that corroborate the story, you knew it was more than just a rumor. Whoever that <b>Gilder</b> was, they’ve covered their tracks well... until now.
    + [I find the harbormaster.] ->RogueEncounter1

==== WizardStart ====
After graduating from your apprenticeship, you and your peers went your separate ways to focus on your own studies. You took up a journeymanship at the <b>archive annex</b>, but it hasn't been what you'd hoped.
The books and scrolls must be kept maintained, organized, cataloged. Little happens out of the routine, but you sneak in reading between the chores. Few have the privilege to glimpse such and if it were just you and the books, you'd be happy.
They have become a sanctuary, a reprieve from the constant bittered needling of the archive matron, the librarian whom you study under. She seems unaware her mood slides between meticulous supervisor into cruel taskmaster. Some days she seems relish in getting in your way, just so she can discipline your supposed ineptitude.
    + [Okay.] ->WizardEncounter1

// ---------CLERIC ENCOUNTER 1 START -------------

Inside the <b>archive annex</b>, the walls are stacked with bookshelves containing a litany of scrolls and tomes both magical and mundane. The matron of the establishment, a stern <b>dragonborn</b> woman in <b>wizard</b> robes with blue scales and a patchy rat upon her shoulder watches you carefully. She looks disapprovingly at your muddy boots, but you walk on. You recall once seeing an open tome with a painting like the image in your dreams on the fifth floor from a previous visit.

You finish out the day's work then near nightfall you stroll into the <b>Beached Leviathan</b> tavern, a three-story extravaganza built inside a ship's hull.

You make your way to what's known as "the hold", a dimly lit room and the bottom floor of the tavern.

You snatch an arm and spin the shadowy figure around. They look wide-eyed and shocked at you. "Wait!" comes a familiar voice, and you recognize the face of your friend, <b>Shawelay</b> in a sliver of light shining from the kitchen.

Almost at once the cloaked figures take step to you and then lunge forwards and cry out in unison "SURPRISE!"
The room lights flare and you see the room is full of the cheery faces of your friends from the docks. Tabnab, a man wearing an apron steps from the door with a festively decorated cake and a serving knife. Strong, timberous dockworkers and thin, sea-worn waifs come up one by one to hug you. Their grins are contagious and you wipe the sweat from your brow.
"What's the surprise you ask?" <b>Shawelay</b> pokes. "Well it's been a year since you put that old saw in his place and it's been the best year of our lives!"
"Here, here!" comes a cheer, then laughter.

Lucky for you, your friends at the fish market are willing to help. You slip under an empty barrel and wait for the scene to unfold. After some time, you hear the crew of the vessel begin to shout. Through a hole in the barrel you spy a scene of carnage, a ten foot shark, snared in a thick net, being dragged down the pier by a dozen men. This wasn't what you had in mind.
The shouts grow louder, then turn to screams as the shark is turned loose in front of the boat. It flips and flops about splintering wood, a whirlwind of gnashing teeth.
<i> The DM Rolls dice.</i>
As it does, its tail slaps against the barrel knocking over and you begin to roll. You tumble inside the barrel as it rolls up against the shark, then with a tailswipe the barrel is flung off the dock.
You splash into the water and water begins to pour in the holes of the barrel.

Three bolts of magic energy shoot from your fingers arcing across the room and strike the monstrous rat. It flips over a banister into the stairwell below and begins to roll, then topple end over end. With each bounce it makes a noise like a squeaky-toy. It reaches the bottom of the stairs, then to your surprise continues falling down the next flight squeaking as it goes.
The matrons eyes wince and water as the noises disappear below. Her scaley jaw begins to quiver.
"LEAVE!" she screams.
